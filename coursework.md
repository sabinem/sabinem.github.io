# My Coursework

Here I collect the material from the courses I study in. It helps me later to revisit the content for my own work.

## Deep Learning

(2017/2018)

In 2017 I discovered Deep Learning and feel like it this is the future of Machine Learning. I am doing two courses on this: 
The Coursera Course from Andrew Ng, one of the pioneers in Machine Learning. In paralell I persue the Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity. I would say that these two courses are orthogonal to each other. Andrew Ng does a very good job on teaching you everything from scratch, while at Udacity you get kind of the birds eye view whats going on in that area of study overall.

## Social Analysis via Data

(2016/2017)

This was what got me first hooked to Machine Learning: How data can be used for predictions about people, their well being, how it can also be abused. This course was a lot about the role data tends to play more and more in our daily lifes.

## Python

(2016/2017)

Python is used for Machine Learning, but Python is used for so much more. It is one of the most popular computer languages today. I consider it close to a natural language, with all pros and cons that brings. It is not always structured in the most logical way I would prefer, but you can do a lot with it and come close to a tool that helps you shaping your thoughts on programming
