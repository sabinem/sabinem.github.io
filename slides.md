# Slides from My Talks

## What's new in Python 3.6?
### - fstrings, numeric literals, secrets, pathlib, asyncio, annotations, new dict implementation, new class creation
(01.2017)

I gave that talk in the Zurich Python User group just after 3.6 came out in December 2016

## Apache Cassandra 
### - an eventually consistent database, that scales with ease
(01/2017)

This talk is from the pydata user group. I was facianted by cassandra when I heard about it. It was my first encounter with a No SQL database. I felt that it would be very appropriate for good customer separation, so that customers data don't mix with each other. On the other hand query possibilities are restricted in Cassandra.
