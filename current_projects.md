## Current Projects

## Documentation of Fish
I decided to seriously get into Open Source contribution. In my Python education I liked a lot that I started at the commandline level and worked my way up into frameworks and Data Science libraries. So I decided to use the same approach for my Open Source contributions. I am currently contributing to `fish`, the interactive and userfriendly shell. I picked up to rather big issue there about rewriting the documentation in a simpler language. So that will keep me busy for a while. But it is also very fun and I can learn a lot that way: 
- about shells and the commandline in general
- about how to write a decent documentation

I will write an article about this, once I am finished. My current thoughts are that documentation should be orthogonal to the doumentation to each single function and command. It should offer a completely different view of the project, then you would get if you add up all the single documentations for all parts.

## NLP Practioner
I am also currently persuing an education to become a Neurolinguistic Programming Practioner. That sounds a lot like just another programming class, but it is rather the opposite, about programming yourself and communicating in a productive way within teams. Most of my classmates come from HR and their goal is to better motivate themselves and the people that report to them.
