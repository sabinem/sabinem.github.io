## Current Projects

## Documentation of Fish
My goal currently is to get seriously into Open Source contribution. 

This is how I proceed with this:

In my Python education I liked a lot that I started at the commandline level and worked my way up into frameworks and Data Science libraries. So I decided to use the same approach for my Open Source contributions. 

- Currently I am involved with **fish**, the interactive and userfriendly shell: there I picked up a rather big issue about rewriting the documentation in a simpler language. That will keep me busy for a while. On the plus side: I am learning a lot!

I will write an article about this, once I am finished.

## NLP Practioner
I am also currently persuing an education to become a Neurolinguistic Programming Practioner. That sounds a lot like just another programming class, but it is rather the opposite: It is about programming yourself and about communicating in a productive way within teams. 

Most of my classmates come from HR and their goal is to better motivate themselves and the people around them.
