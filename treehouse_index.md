# Python Treehouse Techdegree

## My year at Treehouse
What I learned: Python, Flask, Django, Django-Restframework

## Overview over the projects I did there:

### Pure Python Projects

We started from scratch with pure Python, no frameworks:

#### [Project 1: Build a Soccer League](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project1_soccer_league) 
This was a simple file-io exercise with some list comprehensions: we had to build a team rooster for soccer and mail letters to the guardians.

#### [Project 2: Battleship Game](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project2_battleshipgame)
This was a nice exercise for designing classes. Battleships, players and board were all candidates for classes.
