# My year at Treehouse
I accomplished the **Python Treehouse Techdegree**.

## About the Treehouse Techdegree Program
This is a year long program, that takes you through 12 complete Python projects, covering the main frameworks, such as **Django** and **Flask** and state of the art skills for combining frontends with **API Backends**

The focus is on practical projects, that are programmed from scratch. Eventually the frontend is provided, programmed in a Javascript framenwork such as **Angular** or **React** or as pure stylesheets. The goal has been always to match the provided design of the site. In that way the focus was on programming a backend, that fits the frondend teams demands.

## The Skills I got from there
- Python: classes, list comprehension, file-i/o
- the main python webframeworks: Flask, Django
- building an API with Flask or Django-Restframework
- tweaking Angular and React to work with an API Backend
- customizing the Django User

## Tutoring upon graduating
After graduating I continued to help out there as a contractor for 3 month, grading the very projects I had done myself. It was interesting to see all of this from the other side. But after 3 month I felt I wanted to move on.

## Showcasing My Work:

## Pure Python Projects

We started from scratch with pure Python, no frameworks:

### [Project 1: Build a Soccer League](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project1_soccer_league) 
This was a simple **file-io exercise** with some list comprehensions: we had to build a team rooster for soccer and mail letters to the guardians.

### [Project 2: Battleship Game](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project2_battleshipgame)
This was a nice exercise for **designing classes**. Battleships, players and board were all candidates for classes.

### [Project 3: Worklog filebased](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project3_worklog)
Here I build a **dialog system on the command line from scratch**. This worklog was a file based searchable worklog system.

### [Project 4: Worklog with a database](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project4_worklogdb)
We repeated the worklog from project 3 using a database this time and a simple **ORM: Peewee**

## Pure Flask Projects

### [Project 5: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
Our first Project with **Flask** was a Learning Journal, that came with **tagging** and used **markddown**.

### [Project 6: Mineral Catalog with Django](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
This was a datadriven project with **Django**. We builded a searchable catalog for data that was given as a json file.

### [Project 7: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 8: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 9: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 10: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 11: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 12: Social Team Builder](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project12_teambuilder)
In this project the **django user model was customized**, otherwise it used **django formsets**
