## Past Work Experiences

## Sd&M Software Design and Management

(1989 - 1998)

This was a time before github repos even existed. I worked in several projects as a Software Design Engineer for large custom build applications with a variety of langauges and environements.

I took a long break raising my kids, living in the United States with my family, looking into writing

## Startup Mentoki

(2013 - 2016)

My startup was an online platform as a service for coaches. The platform was build by me and I also taught them how to set up shop there.

## Blog Onlinekurstechnik

(2016) 

After the startup I kept for a while a blog helping coaches to start up their online business. The blog was German language. It had the same target group that my startup was serving. My idea was to find a different business model for the same target group. But I finally decided to drop the blog as well, since it was a lot of work and did not have a clear goal any more after my startup had failed.
